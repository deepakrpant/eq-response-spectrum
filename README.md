Code to conduct time-series analysis on an earthquake signal and compute response spectrum.
* infile.txt contains time and acceleration columns
* Period.txt contains periods at which response spectrum needs to be computed
* simply run ResponseSpectrum.py to compute response spectra using above two input files
